# ü§î Why Can't We Just Fetch Google's Public Website?

Great question! Here's the simple explanation:

## The Problem: Browser Security

```javascript
// What you'd expect to work:
const response = await fetch('https://adstransparency.google.com/');
// ‚ùå ERROR: CORS policy blocks this!
```

### 1. **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**
- Browsers block websites from reading other websites
- It's a security feature to prevent data theft
- Google didn't add headers allowing your site to access theirs

### 2. **JavaScript-Rendered Content**
```html
<!-- What fetch() gets: -->
<div id="root">Loading...</div>

<!-- What you actually need (rendered by JavaScript): -->
<div class="ad-container">
  <h3>Nike - Just Do It</h3>
  <p>Shop the latest...</p>
</div>
```

### 3. **Anti-Bot Protection**
- Rate limiting
- User agent checking
- Behavioral analysis
- CAPTCHAs

## The Solution: Server-Side Scraping

Since browsers can't do it, we need servers to:

| Method | How it Works | Cost |
|--------|--------------|------|
| **Your Browser** | ‚ùå Can't access other sites | N/A |
| **Your Server + Playwright** | ‚úÖ Runs real Chrome browser | FREE |
| **ScrapingBee API** | ‚úÖ They run browsers for you | Free tier ‚Üí Paid |
| **Direct API** | ‚ùå Google doesn't offer one | N/A |

## Simple Analogy

Think of it like this:
- **Browser fetch**: Like trying to read a book through a window (blocked)
- **Playwright**: Like sending a robot to go read the book for you (free but complex)
- **ScrapingBee**: Like hiring someone to read the book and tell you what it says (easy but costs)

## Your Options

### Option 1: Free Forever (Playwright)
```bash
npm install playwright
# Your server runs a real browser
```
‚úÖ No limits
‚ùå More complex setup

### Option 2: Free to Start (ScrapingBee)
```
SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY=xxx
# They handle everything
```
‚úÖ Super easy
‚ùå Limited free credits

### Option 3: Just Use Mock Data
‚úÖ Works instantly
‚ùå Not real data

---

**TL;DR**: Browsers can't fetch other websites due to security. You need a server-side solution (free Playwright or easy ScrapingBee) to get real data from Google Ads Transparency Center.
