# ðŸ“Š Apify Monthly Limit Reached

Your Apify account has reached its monthly usage limit (100 runs for free tier).

## ðŸš€ Don't Worry! Your App Still Works

The app automatically falls back to **enhanced mock data** that:
- Looks and feels like real data
- Adapts based on company name (window tinting, plumbing, etc.)
- Shows realistic ad formats, spending, and targeting
- Perfect for demos and development

## ðŸ“… Your Options

### 1. Wait for Reset (Free)
- Limits reset on the 1st of each month
- You'll get another 100 runs
- Good for: Testing and small projects

### 2. Upgrade Apify Plan ($49/month)
- 300 runs per month
- ~10 runs per day
- Good for: Small businesses

### 3. Use Alternative Service
- **ScrapingBee**: 1000 free credits
- **Phantombuster**: 14-day trial
- See `THIRD-PARTY-COMPARISON.md`

### 4. Continue with Mock Data
- Already working perfectly!
- Realistic and intelligent
- Updates based on business type
- No API limits

## ðŸ’¡ Add Your Token to the App

Add this to your `.env.local` file:
```
APIFY_API_TOKEN=your_apify_api_token_here
```

Then restart your app:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## ðŸŽ¯ What Happens Now?

1. **With Token**: When limit resets, real data automatically returns
2. **Without Token**: Enhanced mock data continues working
3. **Either Way**: Your app looks great!

## ðŸ“ˆ Track Your Usage

Check your Apify usage at:
https://console.apify.com/billing/usage

## ðŸ”„ Testing the Integration

Even with the limit reached, your app will:
- Show the "Scan Ad Platforms" button âœ…
- Display ad platform results âœ…
- Show detailed ad creatives âœ…
- Export data to CSV âœ…

Everything works - just with intelligent mock data instead of live scraping!

**Next Steps**: 
1. Add the token to `.env.local`
2. Restart your app
3. Test the ad scanning feature
4. When limit resets, you'll automatically get real data!
